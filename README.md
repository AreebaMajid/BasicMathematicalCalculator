# Basic Mathematical Calculator


**Internship Task ‚Äì Level 2, Task 1**
**Organization**: Oasis Infobyte
**Role**: Web Development & Designing Intern
**Duration**: July 2025 ‚Äì August 2025

As part of the **Web Development and Designing Internship at Oasis Infobyte**, I completed Level 2 ‚Äì Task 1, which involved building a **fully functional calculator web application** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The objective was to create an interactive calculator capable of performing basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The layout was designed using **CSS Grid** for proper alignment and responsiveness. The JavaScript logic used **event listeners**, **conditional statements**, **operators**, and **loops** to handle real-time input, process calculations, and display results efficiently. This project enhanced my understanding of front-end technologies, DOM manipulation, and clean UI design.

### üîß Features:

* Perform basic operations: **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division**
* Responsive and clean layout using **CSS Grid**
* Real-time input/output display on the calculator screen
* Clear (`C`) button to reset all inputs
* User-friendly and intuitive interface

---

### üß† Key Concepts Practiced:

* **HTML** for structure
* **CSS** for layout and styling using Grid
* **JavaScript** for logic and interactivity
* **DOM manipulation** and **event handling**
* Use of **if-else statements**, **loops**, and **operators** to process input

### üìå Task Reference (from Internship Brief):

> "It takes a little skill to create a calculator with basic mathematical functionalities using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Calculators require an interactive interface to perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. It will need a display screen to display the user's input and give the results. The grid system in CSS is for the alignments of buttons on the calculator. The additional tools you need to build a fully functional calculator include eventListeners, if-else statements, operators, loops, and so on."

### üñºÔ∏è Output / Project Preview:

Here‚Äôs how the calculator looks and functions:


* Neatly aligned buttons for numbers and operators
* Display screen showing input and calculated result
* Simple, modern styling for a clean UI
* Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile browsers
